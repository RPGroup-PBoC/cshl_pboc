## Introductory Materials

* [Setting up Python for scientific programming](../../../../code/html/t0_setting_up_python.html) \| This brief tutorial contains instructions to get Python and peripherals set up on your computer.

Below are links to some courses you may find useful for learning programming
and data analysis in biology.

* [Introduction to Programming in the Biological Sciences](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2016/) \| A pboc-style course in which you learn practical programming in one weeks' time.

* [Data Analysis in the Biological Sciences](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2016/) \| A wonderful course which teaches the theory and practice of Bayesian statistics using biological data. The tutorials are shown in detail in Python.

## Data sets

Please download the following data sets, unzip them, and place them in your `pboc/data` folder as described in the [setting up Python](../../../../code/html/setting_up_python.html) tutorial.

* [Data Set 1](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/sizing_up_ecoli.zip) \| A phase contrast image of bacteria and a graticule.
* [Data Set 2](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip) \| A series of phase contrast and fluorescence images of a growing *E. coli* colony
* [Data Set 3](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/french_flag.zip) \| Images of developing fly embryos for identification of the position of the cephalic furrow.
* [Data Set 4](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/lacI_titration.zip) \| A large image set of *E. coli* strains with varying copy numbers of the lacI repressor molecule.
* [Data Set 5](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/fly_elongation.zip)
\| An image set of 5' and 3' labeled mRNA expressing in the developing
_Drosophila_ embryo.
* [Data Set 6](../../../../code/data/yeast_smFISH_data.zip) \| mRNA distributions for two genes in yeast measured by single-molecule FISH from [Zenklusen et. al. (2008)](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/PBoC_CSHL_2017/zenklusen_etal_yeastFISH.pdf.pdf)


## Course Python Utilities
As sometimes syntax can be difficult, we have written a file with a few functions written in Python that will make some of the in-class exercises less cumbersome. Please download them below and place them in your root `pboc` folder as described in the [setting up Python](../../../../code/html/setting_up_python.html) tutorial.

* [`pboc_utils.py`](../../../../code/pboc_utils.py) \| Course utilities.

## Course Exercises
As we go through the course, the code we write in class will be posted here. When possible, extra tutorials with more detail and explanation will be posted as well.

* [Exercise 1](../../../../code/ecoli_growth_fluorescence.py) \| Measuring the
    growth rate of *E. coli* cells growing on LB. [\[data
    set\]](https://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/course_data/ecoli_growth.zip)[\[in
    class\]](../../../../code/inclass/ecoli_growth_in_class.py)

* [Exercise 2](../../../../code/master_equation_diffusion.py) \| "Spreading
    the butter:" diffusion by numerically integrating the master equation
    and simulating FRAP. [\[in
    class\]](../../../../code/inclass/master_equation_diffusion.py)
