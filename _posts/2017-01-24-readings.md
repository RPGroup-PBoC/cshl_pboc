## Supplementary reading

The papers provided here are meant to provide an entry point
into the literature for going more deeply into various topics
covered -in class.   These papers have been picked either
because they provide interesting and provocative experimental
measurements of particular biological phenomena or because they
show how to go about constructing theoretical models in the
physical biology spirit described in the course. The papers
that of most direct relevance to what we will cover in class
are linked on the "Syllabus" part of the website.

    Hernan Garcia and Rob Phillips (2011), <i>Quantitative dissection of the simple repression input-output function</i>, PNAS 108(29) pp. 12173-8.</a><br />
This paper demonstrates that thermodynamic models can make
quantitative predictions about the level of gene expression as
a function of repressor copy number and operator strength.

<a href="http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/PBoC_CSHL_2015/files_2015/articles/bintu%20Curr%20Op%20Gen%20Dev%20Models%202005.pdf">

    Ido Golding (2005), <i>Real-time kinetics of gene activity in individual bacteria,</i> Cell 123, pp. 1025-36.</a> <br />

This paper clearly demonstrates that the process by which mRNA
is produced in the E.coli cell is stochastic in nature. A
surprising observation is that the mRNA distribution is not
Poisson, characterized by bursts in mRNA production. To this
day the source of the stochasticity remains a mystery.

<div id="file-links">
 <a href="http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/PBoC_CSHL_2015/files_2015/articles/gregor+al_05.pdf">
Thomas Gregor et al. (2005), <i>Diffusion and scaling during early embryonic pattern formation,</i> PNAS 102, pp. 18403-7.</a>

cannot account for morphogen gradient scaling in early embryos
across closely related fly species.


### Evolution

 [Theodsius Dobzhansky (1973), *Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution*, The American Biology Teacher 3, 125-9](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/courses/PBoC_CSHL_2015/files_2015/articles/Dobzhansky_1973.pdf)
This classic article makes a compelling case for the primacy of evolution in the study of biology.
